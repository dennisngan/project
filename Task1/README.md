## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Patterns

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation between GUI, business logic, and data access. Several classical OOP design patterns are applied throughout.

### Layered Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               GUI Layer                 │  PySide6 windows, dialogs, widgets
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│             Service Layer               │  Business logic (auth, cart, products…)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Model Layer                │  Domain objects (User, Product, Transaction…)
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Database Layer                │  Singleton SQLite wrapper (DatabaseManager)
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Patterns

| Pattern | Where Used | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Singleton** | `DatabaseManager` | Ensures a single shared SQLite connection throughout the application lifetime |
| **Abstract Base Class (ABC)** | `BaseModel`, `PaymentMethod` | Enforces a `from_db_row()` factory on every model; enforces `process_payment()` on every payment type |
| **Strategy** | `CashPayment` / `CardPayment` → `PaymentMethod` | Swaps payment behaviour at runtime without changing the calling code; open to new payment types without modification (Open/Closed Principle) |
| **Factory Method** | `User.from_db_row()` | Returns a `Manager` or `Cashier` subclass instance based on the `role` column — callers work against the `User` interface and get role-specific behaviour polymorphically |
| **Service Layer** | `AuthService`, `CartService`, `ProductService`, `TransactionService`, `UserService` | Keeps all business logic out of the GUI; each service owns one domain area |

### Class Hierarchy

```
BaseModel (ABC)
├── User
│   ├── Manager       — has MANAGE_PRODUCTS + MANAGE_USERS permissions
│   └── Cashier       — POS sales only
├── Product
├── Category
├── Transaction
└── TransactionItem

PaymentMethod (ABC)
├── CashPayment       — validates tendered amount, calculates change
└── CardPayment       — mocked gateway, stores last-4 card digits
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Five tables, all created automatically on first launch via `DatabaseManager._create_tables()`.

```
categories
  PK  category_id
      name

products
  PK  product_id
      name
      price
      cost_price
      stock_quantity
      is_active
  FK  category_id        →  categories.category_id  (SET NULL on delete)

users
  PK  user_id
      username
      password_hash
      full_name
      role               CHECK ('cashier' | 'manager')

transactions
  PK  transaction_id
      timestamp
  FK  cashier_id         →  users.user_id            (SET NULL on delete)
      total_amount
      payment_type
      amount_tendered
      change_due
      card_last_four
      is_void

transaction_items
  PK  transaction_item_id
  FK  transaction_id     →  transactions.transaction_id  (CASCADE on delete)
  FK  product_id         →  products.product_id          (SET NULL on delete)
      product_name       ← snapshot of name at sale time
      quantity
      unit_price
      line_total
```

**Key design decisions:**
- `transaction_items.product_name` snapshots the product name at sale time so historical receipts remain accurate even if the product is later renamed or deleted.
- Foreign keys use `ON DELETE SET NULL` (not `CASCADE`) on `cashier_id` and `product_id` so that deleting a user or product never erases historical transaction data.
- `is_void` flag on `transactions` soft-deletes a sale and triggers stock restoration rather than hard-deleting the row.

## 🔑 Default Accounts

The database is seeded automatically on first launch with the following accounts:

| Role | Username | Password |
|---|---|---|
| 👔 Manager | `admin` | `admin123` |
| 💼 Cashier | `cashier1` | `cash123` |
| 💼 Cashier | `cashier2` | `cash123` |

> 👔 Managers have full access to the Dashboard (products, transactions, users).
> 💼 Cashiers can only process sales on the main POS window.

## 🚀 Installation & Running

### Option 1 — UV (Recommended)

[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) handles virtualenv and dependencies in one step.

```bash
# Install UV (if not already installed)
# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Sync dependencies and run
uv sync
uv run main.py
```

### Option 2 — Conda

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.12 required)
conda create -n smart-pos python=3.12

# Activate the environment and install dependencies
conda activate smart-pos
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```
---

## 🏗️ Build a Standalone Executable (PyInstaller)

A pre-configured `SmartPOS.spec` file is included so you can produce a single self-contained `.exe` without any extra flags.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# with conda
pip install pyinstaller

# or with UV dev dependencies
uv sync --group dev
```

### Build

Run the following command from the `Task1/` directory:

```bash
# with conda
pyinstaller SmartPOS.spec

# or with UV dev dependencies
uv run pyinstaller SmartPOS.spec
```

The finished executable is written to:

```
Task1/dist/SmartPOS.exe
```

Double-click `SmartPOS.exe` to launch — no Python installation required on the target machine. The database file (`smartpos.db`) is created automatically next to the executable on first run.

### What the spec does

- **Entry point:** `main.py`
- **Mode:** `--onefile` (single bundled executable, no `_internal/` folder)
- **Console:** hidden (windowed GUI only, no terminal window)
- **Bundled assets:** `asset/store_icon.ico` (window and taskbar icon)
- **UPX compression:** enabled (reduces file size)

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ Single terminal | No multi-terminal or networked POS support — all sales run on one machine |
| 💱 Currency | Hardcoded to HKD (HKD$); no multi-currency support |
| 💳 Card payments | Card processing is mocked (`sleep(1)` + always approves) — no real payment gateway integration |
| 📊 Reporting | No sales summary, daily totals, or profit/loss reports |
| 📧 Digital receipts | Receipts are PDF only — no email or SMS delivery |
| 🔄 Concurrency | SQLite WAL mode is enabled but the app is single-process; not suitable for simultaneous multi-user access |
| 🌐 No cloud sync | Database is local only; no backup or remote-sync mechanism |
| ♿ Accessibility | No screen-reader support or keyboard-only navigation beyond standard Qt defaults |

---

## 🔮 Future Work

| Enhancement | Description |
|---|---|
| 🌐 REST API backend | Replace direct SQLite calls with a FastAPI / Django REST backend to support multi-terminal deployments |
| 💳 Real payment gateway | Integrate Stripe or a local POS SDK for actual card processing |
| 📊 Sales dashboard | Add charts for daily/weekly revenue, top-selling products, and low-stock alerts |
| 📧 Email receipts | Send PDF receipts directly to customers via SMTP |
| 🔄 Cloud backup | Periodic sync of `smartpos.db` to cloud storage (e.g. S3, Google Drive) |
| 🌍 Multi-currency | Support configurable store currency and exchange rates |
| 🧾 Discount & promotions | Apply item-level or cart-level discount codes |
| 🏷️ Barcode scanning | Integrate USB barcode scanner for faster product lookup |
